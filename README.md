This application is a simple GUI designed for the user to run multiple apps at the same time. Users can add apps (ie Chrome, Spotify, Steam, Finale, and etc.) and with a simple click of a button every app listed will start. 

## Development
This app is built in Python and comes from a youtube tutorial by the channel Dev ED. [Here is the video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE-SpRI3K5g) [and here is the channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q)

## Rationale
Python is a language that I have not used before, and that I want to start learning, or at least familiarizing myself with. Thus, I have used the aforementioned tutorial to build this app. 

## Using the App
The app can be started via two methods. If the user has python installed, they can enter the command 'python app.py' in their terminal. 

This app can also be run directly from file explorer (or the equivalent GUI on your os).
