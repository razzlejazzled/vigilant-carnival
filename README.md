This application is a simple GUI designed for the user to run multiple apps at the same time. Users can add apps (ie Chrome, Spotify, etc.) and with a simple click of a button every app listed will start. 

## Development
This app is built in Python and comes from a youtube tutorial by the channel Dev ED [here is the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE-SpRI3K5g)

## Rationale
Python is a language that I have not used before, and that I want to start learning, or at least familiarizing myself with. Thus, I have used the aforementioned tutorial to build this app.
